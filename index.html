<!-- put stuff in there-->
<!-- somehow add: 
- Field campaigns with emphasis in calibration, deployment, flexibility
- Designing for occupant agency
  
Field campaigns:
 - Assessing passively ventilated IAQ of vernacular architecture in Kenya among women redesigning their kitchens:
 "Wagner 2022" - link to study
 -monitoring actively ventilated IAQ in a grad student office building via
  (link) ultrafine particle dynamics throughout a commercial-scale HVAC  "Wagner 2024"
- Current work: Monitoring environmental quality and biometrics in a Durham cohort with intent to scale
 link to Bergin lab

 Experiential Engagement:

 Keywords to keep for later: 
 - intent to scale
 - building intuition
